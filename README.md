Automated Street Light based on PIR Sensor and Smoke Sensor using Arduino UNO:

In this project, I decided to implement an automated street light sytsem that makes use of PIR and Smoke sensor to turn on street light whenever needed. Instead of keeping the lights on all the time, the street light can turn on only when it detects vehicular movement, thus saving electricity. In case of accidents or emergencies, it can detect the smoke coming from the vehicle and turn on the lights to alert surrounding people of an accident.
